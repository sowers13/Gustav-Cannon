sort of a random collection of projects

speech.py 
-speech to text
-listens via user device's headphones to transcribe speech to text. If on mac, recommended to switch microphone to 'Voice Isolation'.
-kinda fun
Note: does not work with synthetic voices or those generated by AI. Human voice is more easily transcribable.
